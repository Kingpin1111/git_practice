Badminton Social is a full-stack Web app giving badminton players a platform to connect with other enthusiasts.

## How it works?
The workflow is similar to a social media website (think Twitter or Facebook!!). The user is prompted to create an account, and upon that can now connect with users to post/comment/like messages(screams), add friends, and customize their profile for other badminton fanatics to view.

## What did I learn?
Creating this project provided me with strong fundamental knowledge of software development in each area of a web application, examples include managing the user's state from the client-side in real-time using React-Redux, using promise-based HTTP requests on both front-end and backend to persist data properly, and creating REST API functions using Firebase Functions to directly manage user-inputted data to the database.

## Project Specs:
- Front-end is built using React-Redux, and styles using the Material-UI library.
- The backend is a REST API created using Node.js, Express and axios to help send client and server-side requests.
- The database is built using Firebase's Cloud NoSQL Firestore document database.
